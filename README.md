Visualization of Model Calibration Using PyTorch's framework for model parameter Gradient Descent and automatic differentiation. 
Visualization implemented for 
(1) OLS LR fitting on linear data + noise.
(2) NN fitting on sine data, no noise. Animation is sped up x6.
(3) NN fitting on sine data + noise. Animation is sped up x15.


Data is RED, model is BLUE.
