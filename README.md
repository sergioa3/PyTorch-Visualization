Visualization of Model Calibration Using PyTorch's framework for model parameter Gradient Descent and automatic differentiation. 
Visualization implemented for 
<br>
(1) OLS LR fitting on linear data + noise.
<br>
(2) NN fitting on sine data, no noise. Animation is sped up x6.
<br>
(3) NN fitting on sine data + noise. Animation is sped up x15.
<br>
<br>

Both models are being fit to reduce MSE.
<br>
Data is RED, model is BLUE.
